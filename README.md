# Code-Quiz

This webpage runs a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals and saves high scores. When the page loads it presents the user with instructions, a start game button, and a view highscores button. If start game is selected then a timer, visible in the top right corner, starts ticking down from 60, and the user is presented with the quiz's first question and 4 answer choices. When the user answers a question, they are presented with the next question, and informed whether they got the previous question right or wrong. Whenever the user answers a question incorrectly they are penalized by reducing their time remaining by 10 seconds. When all questions are answered or the timer reaches zero, then the game is over, at which point the user is informed of their score (the remaining time), and given the option to save their score along with their initials. They are then presented with the top 5 highscores from local data (or less if there are not yet 5 scores saved), including the latest score (if it's high enough to break into the top 5). The user may clear these scores, or press home to return to the instructions page.
